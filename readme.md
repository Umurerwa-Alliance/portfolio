# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website developed as part of the Advanced Web Design and Development course at the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} (INES-Ruhengeri), Faculty of Sciences and Information Technology.

The portfolio demonstrates my technical foundation in frontend development, UI engineering skills, and ability to build a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using templates or website builders.

The website presents my profile, skills, academic projects, curriculum vitae, and an interactive JavaScript calculator.
